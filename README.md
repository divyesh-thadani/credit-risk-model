Credit Risk & Loan Approval Prediction App 🏦
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of a loan being approved based on an applicant's details. It includes the entire pipeline from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and deployment as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

🚀 Live Demo & Screenshot
Below is a screenshot of the final web application. The interface allows users to input applicant information on a sidebar and receive an instant prediction on the main page.

🌟 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a reliable model to help financial institutions automate the loan eligibility process. By analyzing historical loan data, the model learns to identify key factors that influence loan approval. The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and creating a user-friendly front-end interface for real-world interaction.

✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and converts categorical data into a machine-readable format.

Model Training: Utilizes a Logistic Regression model to classify loan applications.

Model Persistence: Saves the trained model to a file (.pkl) for later use, separating the training process from prediction.

Interactive UI: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Dynamic Prediction: Users can modify input features on-the-fly and get instant feedback from the model.

Confidence Score: Displays the model's confidence in its prediction (probability).

🔧 Technology Stack
Language: Python 3.9+

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization during EDA (in the initial script).

⚙️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)divyesh-thadani/credit-risk-model.git
cd credit-risk-model

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's a best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, create one with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the libraries mentioned above.)

4. Download the Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle: Loan Prediction Dataset.

Find the file train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv.

Rename it to loan_data.csv and place it in the root directory of the project.

💡 Usage
The project is split into two main parts: training the model and running the application.

1. Train the Model
First, you need to run the training script. This will process the data and create the loan_model.pkl file.

python train_model.py

You only need to do this once, or whenever you want to retrain the model.

2. Run the Streamlit App
Once the model file is created, start the web application.

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's URL.

🔮 Future Improvements
Try Different Models: Experiment with more advanced models like RandomForestClassifier or XGBoost to see if accuracy can be improved.

Model Explainability: Integrate libraries like SHAP or LIME to explain why the model made a certain prediction.

Cloud Deployment: Deploy the Streamlit application to a cloud service like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS for public access.

Add More EDA: Expand the web app to include a page for Exploratory Data Analysis with interactive plots.

CI/CD Pipeline: Implement a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
